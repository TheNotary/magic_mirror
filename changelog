** 0.0.x **
  TODO:  List off what features you'll be including at some point in the
future.

	- Test against port in use problem.

  - How do you tell the host gem to just 'listen for commands' and idle there?
    > Call @magic_mirror.gaze_into to start event machine,
      create a defered faye client,
      make a subscription with said client
      then block with EM.run

      When a message is published to the subscribed channel, ruby can
      respond accordingly, with full access to the gem and ruby landscape...
      but ppl shouldn't directly eval the strings coming in over httpPost...

  - limitation:  Can only have one rendering display at a time *per computer*
      > Solution: Clean up the output and make ports random

  - Bug:  If faye server goes offline for a second, and misses commands, then comes back online,
    the command_cache variable will be out of sync with that of the server
      > Solutions:  Javascript Function periodically checks in to see the
        md5 checksum of server's command_cache and if the browser's is out of date
        it performs a reset

  - Think of other popular uses for rendering...
  - secure by making servers listen only on localhost



Currently:

  - The tree example takes forever to draw
    > Cache commands before sending through websockets:
      cache websockets commands and wait 0.1 seconds between each
      message sent...
      ... it's also just a hell of a lot of data...

    > Compress the command_cache: if the commands can be condensed so they
      take up fewer characters, performance will improve dramatically.
      *
      *

    > Dynamically build the tree function in javascript and reduce the command
      to 1 function definition plus an invocation...

    > What if command_cache SVG data instead of function calls?

Finished:
