** 0.0.x **
  TODO:  List off what features you'll be including at some point in the
future.

  - Bug:  If faye server goes offline for a second, and misses commands, then comes back online,
    the command_cache variable will be out of sync with that of the server
      > Solutions:  Javascript Function periodically checks in to see the
        md5 checksum of server's command_cache and if the browser's is out of date
        it performs a reset

  - Think of other popular uses for rendering...
  - secure by making servers listen only on localhost

  - Hide the STDOUT from starting the servers and print the
    address of the listening http server in a pretty manor that links

  - Write wrapper for TkcOval, btw...

Currently:
