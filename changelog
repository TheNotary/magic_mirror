** 0.0.x **

	- Test against port in use problem.

	- Generally add tests... consider using trtl as an integration test subject...

  - How do you tell the host gem to just 'listen for commands' and idle there?
    > Call @magic_mirror.gaze_into to start event machine,
      create a defered faye client,
      make a subscription with said client
      then block with EM.run

      When a message is published to the subscribed channel, ruby can
      respond accordingly, with full access to the gem and ruby landscape...
      but ppl shouldn't directly eval the strings coming in over httpPost...

  - limitation:  Can only have one rendering display at a time *per computer*
      > Solution: Make ports random?
      > Solution: Make 1 port, but make things accessible as /roots/myRoot

  - secure by making servers listen only on localhost for websockets
