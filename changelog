** 0.0.x **
  TODO:  List off what features you'll be including at some point in the
future.


Currently:

  - Setup command_cache
    > Make all canvas commands append to MagicMirror's @command_cache

  - Setup javascript for drawing to canvas
    > So with using tk in ruby, ruby calls to the TK library, and TK replies with... IDs of objects created...
    > So when I send commands to javascript... do I need to grab the responses???
    > ughh... I should look how to draw lines with canvas before proceeding
  - Think of other popular uses for rendering...


Finished:
